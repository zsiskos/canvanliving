                            <p>
                                We know what you’re thinking.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Why would a young, financially independent, happily married
                                couple, choose to sell (almost) everything they own to live in
                                a van?”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Living in a van was never a "bucket list" item for us (like
                                seeing the Northern Lights or going to Burning Man). It's come
                                about from a series of events and life choices. But couldn't
                                you say that about pretty much everything? You find yourself
                                in a situation and then you have 3 choices:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Yes, I'm fond of this situation and would like to continue
                                    it.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    No, not really digging this, need to figure something else
                                    out.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                And it's not even so black and white like that, is it? Because
                                sometimes you start out really fond of something and then it
                                changes, or YOU change, and then you need to figure it all out
                                again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What you don't want to happen, which is what too many people
                                do, is choice 3:
                            </p>
                            <ol start="3">
                                <li>
                                    Nope, not liking this at all, but I'm too afraid to do
                                    anything because I don't really know what I want so I'll
                                    just wait it out and complain about it.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                And the reason so many people are afraid to do anything is
                                because they have some sort of unrealistic expectation about
                                what success means and/or they're too afraid of what people
                                will think of them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thankfully, we've come to learn that success is not a
                                constant, it's not this thing you <em>get</em>. Success
                                is about overcoming challenges and learning new things (about
                                yourself, and the people and world around you). And while
                                we can't truthfully say that we don't totally care
                                what people think about us, we can say that we like
                                it when people think we're weird and pushing boundaries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Okay, but why a van?</strong>

                                We're always trying new stuff, going off in strange and
                                adventurous directions, but one thing we’ve always agreed on
                                is that we want to be in the ultimate F/U position (<a

                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">From the wise words of Frank from "The Gambler"</a>). In a
                                nutshell, all it means is that we always get to do
                                what we want to do. It’s not that we are running from
                                obligations or responsibilities, or goals and dreams. It’s
                                that we want our choices to always be based on
                                what <em>we</em> think is best and not because of
                                social pressures, or a boss, or something preventable, like
                                debt.

                                we agreed that this lifestyle was not for us. We had been
                                drawn to the <em><strong>freedom</strong></em> of the #vanlife movement and
                                decided to give the
                                travelling-homeiswhereyouparkit-buildsomethingwithmyownhands-minimalist
                                lifestyle a try.

                                <strong>We could be totally wrong, and we don't
                                    care.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, we could wake up one day and regret getting rid
                                of most of our possessions, for spending all this effort
                                building our home from scratch, hating that we have no
                                fixed address. We could be making a big, honking, huge
                                mistake.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's a small part of us that hopes that it is. Because
                                we know that we will learn way more from these kinds
                                of mistakes than from anything else.

                                Have you ever been in a situation where you felt scared?
                                Not like, “oh my god, is that a serial killer scared” but
                                the kind that’s like “oh, am I good enough to do this job?”
                                or “will this person like me?” or “Am I going to make a fool
                                of myself on that stage?” kind of scared. You know, LIFE
                                stuff. The stuff that makes you feel anxious and doubt
                                whether you have the capacity to get up in the morning. The
                                kind of situations you do your best to AVOID entirely rather
                                than deal with whatever shitty consequences will come your
                                way.

                            <p>
                                Yes, you have been in those kinds of situations. We all
                                have.>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now imagine this - you're faced with a situation that makes
                                you feel that super anxious feeling and instead of
                                doing anything you can to avoid it, you you embrace
                                it! Imagine that feeling of WANTING to move forward,
                                even though you are scared. That feeling, that rush - that's
                                bravery! Yes, you! Don’t confuse it with thinking that the
                                world will feel less scary, but the opposite - that the
                                situation is scary, maybe even more scary that you had
                                originally thought, but you are still able to face it, head
                                on, and know that you'll deal with whatever the outcome
                                is.

                                Can you image that? Or does imagining that still make you
                                feel like you want to crawl under your bed and curl up in a
                                little ball?

                            <p>
                                I’ve never considered myself an adventurous person, I’ve
                                always taken calculated risks. It never made sense to do
                                something where the likelihood of a negative income was
                                higher than a positive one. Everything in my life was
                                controlled and structured and I was enjoying that kind of
                                success.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But obviously there was something inside that wasn’t happy
                                with that kind of living and when I met James he certainly
                                brought it out of me. He’s much more carefree and since
                                meeting him I’ve done all sorts of things that have called
                                upon my bravery - like jumping out of a plane, learning to
                                ride a motorcycle, playing roller derby, oh, and selling
                                everything we own to move into a tiny van into a big scary
                                city where I don’t know anything.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s not like those things don’t scare me. It’s not like I
                                don’t doubt myself when trying new things. I’m still
                                TERRIFIED. But now, NOT doing them is more scary than doing
                                them.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Why should you do things that scare you>?</strong></p>

                                James sent me this video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/ijdr4eJcdHQ" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Deal with Anxiety</a>" by Dr.
                                Jordan Peterson (amazingly brilliant clinical
                                psychologist, seriously, go learn from him). And after
                                watching it, everything - the roller derby, the jumping out
                                of planes, the moving into a van - it all made sense to
                                me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The world is a horrible place. No, that’s not an
                                understatement.
                                <strong>The universe is under no obligation to make my life easy
                                    or fun or successful</strong>. It’s no surprise that going out into the world
                                creates anxiety and depression, if I’m not feeling equipped to
                                handle what comes my way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to the research that Dr. Peterson refers to in
                                the video, the way to combat this anxiety is to voluntarily
                                put yourself in situations of risk. That’s right. Instead of
                                doing everything you can to make your life easier or to numb
                                the pain, go out there and CHOOSE to face the thing you are
                                scared of. Clinical research shows that when you voluntarily
                                (this is KEY) expose yourself to these anxiety-ridden
                                situations your psychological response teaches you to become
                                BRAVER. It’s not that the world becomes less scary, it’s
                                that you see yourself as a person who is willing to do these
                                things on a consistent basis and this is good for your
                                self-esteem.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Selling everything I own, living a harder life that I
                                wouldn’t know the outcome of, making things DIFFICULT and
                                putting myself in the way uncertainty, IS the way to treat
                                anxiety.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s not making my life easier. No. It’s about gaining the
                                confidence and knowledge that I can deal with this stuff. To
                                paraphrase the fine Dr., there’s something about taking
                                that on as a voluntary challenge
                                that grows and thrives within me as a response.
                                (and this is also why I consistently say that our life
                                is so much different that people who are FORCED to live this way.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, you don’t have to live in a van. But maybe stop trying
                                to make your life so damn easy. Go out and CHOOSE to do
                                things that make you suffer a bit. Because, as Dr. Peterson
                                so eloquently puts it,

                                This morning (at time of writing this) I noticed that
                                we reached 500 subscribers on YouTube! 500! People
                                have spent over 107,000 minutes watching 36
                                videos we’ve created documenting our crazy adventure and it
                                made me give pause and think about what we’ve done in such
                                little time.

                                and meet incredible people, and barely have to go far or
                                spend any money to do so.
                            </p>

                                With all the craziness in this world I’m so thankful for
                                this community, our little place in the world that is fun
                                and exciting and challenging, a place where we can connect
                                with others online and off.
                            </p>

                                It may seem like little things to be thankful for but
                                know that today is not the only day we're thankful
                                for them.
                            </p>
