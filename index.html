                                    I know what you’re thinking.


                                    “Why would a young, financially independent, happily married couple, choose to sell (almost) everything they own to live in a van?”
                                    
                                    Living in a van was never a "bucket list" item for me (like seeing the Northern Lights or going to Burning Man). It's come about from a series of events and life choices. But couldn't you say that about pretty much everything? You find yourself in a situation and then you have 3 choices:
                                    
                                    1) Yes, I'm fond of this situation and would like to continue it.
                                    
                                    2) No, not really digging this, need to figure something else out.
                                    
                                    And it's not even so black and white like that, is it? Because sometimes you start out really fond of something and then it changes, or YOU change, and then you need to figure it all out again.
                                    
                                    What you don't want to happen, which is what too many people do, is choice 3:
                                    
                                    3) Nope, not liking this at all, but I'm too afraid to do anything because I don't really know what I want so I'll just wait it out and complain about it.
                                    
                                    And the reason so many people are afraid to do anything is because they have some sort of unrealistic expectation about what success means and/or they're too afraid of what people will think of them.
                                    
                                    Thankfully, I've come to learn that success is not a constant, it's not this thing you get. Success is about overcoming challenges and learning new things (about yourself, and the people and world around you). And, thankfully x2, while I can't truthfully say that I don't totally care what people think about me, I can say that I like it when people think I am weird and pushing boundaries.
                                    
                                    Okay, but why a van?
                                    
                                    
                                    My best-friend-hubby-partner and I are always trying new stuff, going off in strange and adventurous directions, but one thing we’ve always agreed on is that we want to be in the ultimate F/U position (that doesn't stand for "follow up"). In a nutshell, all it means is that we always get to do what we want to do. It’s not that we are running from obligations or responsibilities, or goals and dreams. It’s that we want our choices to always be based on what we think is best and not because of social pressures, or a boss, or something preventable, like debt.
                                    
                                    After a time of experiencing what most people would call "success" (i.e. bighouse-fancyjobtitle-exoticcars-shinythings) we agreed that this lifestyle was not for us. We had been drawn to the freedom of the #vanlife movement and decided to give the travelling-homeiswhereyouparkit-buildsomethingwithmyownhands-minimalist lifestyle a try.
                                    
                                    I could be totally wrong, and I don't care.
                                    
                                    Yes, I could wake up one day and kick myself for getting rid of all of my possessions, for spending all this effort building my home from scratch, hating that I have no fixed address. I fully admit I could be making a big, honking, huge mistake.
                                    
                                    There's a small part of me that hopes that it is. Because I know that I will learn way more from my mistakes than from anything else.

Not like, “oh my god, is that a serial killer scared” but the kind that’s like “oh, am I good enough to do this job?” or “will this person like me?” or “Am I going to make a fool of myself on that stage?” kind of scared. You know, LIFE stuff. <!--more-->The stuff that makes you feel anxious and doubt whether you have the capacity to get up in the morning. The kind of situations you do your best to AVOID entirely rather than deal with whatever shitty consequences will come your way.</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes, you have been in those kinds of situations. We all have.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now imagine this - you're faced with a situation that makes you feel that super anxious feeling and&nbsp;instead of doing anything you can to avoid it, you you embrace it!&nbsp;Imagine that feeling of WANTING to move forward, even though you are scared. That feeling, that rush - that's bravery! Yes, you! Don’t confuse it with thinking that the world will feel less scary, but the opposite - that the situation is scary, maybe even more scary that you had originally thought, but you are still able to face it, head on, and know that you'll deal with whatever the outcome is.</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Can you image that? Or does imagining that still make you feel like you want to crawl under your bed and curl up in a little ball?</span></p>
                                    <h1 class="p1"><span class="s1">BEING BRAVE</span></h1>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve never considered myself an adventurous person, I’ve always taken calculated risks. It never made sense to do something where the likelihood of a negative income was higher than a positive one. Everything in my life was controlled and structured and I was enjoying that kind of success.</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">But obviously there was something inside that wasn’t happy with that kind of living and when I met James he certainly brought it out of me. He’s much more carefree and since meeting him I’ve done all sorts of things that have called upon my bravery - like jumping out of a plane, learning to ride a motorcycle, playing roller derby, oh, and selling everything we own to move into a tiny van into a big scary city where I don’t know anything.</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not like those things don’t scare me. It’s not like I don’t doubt myself when trying new things. I’m still TERRIFIED. But now, NOT doing them is more scary than doing them.</span></p>
                                    <h1 class="p1"><span class="s1">WHY DO I DO THINGS THAT SCARE ME?</span></h1>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">James sent me this video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/ijdr4eJcdHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Deal with Anxiety</a>" by Dr. Jordan Peterson (amazingly brilliant clinical psychologist, seriously, go learn from him). And after watching it, everything - the roller derby, the jumping out of planes, the moving into a van - it all made sense to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world is a horrible place. No, that’s not an understatement. <strong>The universe is under no obligation to make my life easy or fun or successful</strong>. It’s no surprise that going out into the world creates anxiety and depression, if I’m not feeling equipped to handle what comes my way.&nbsp;</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the research that Dr. Peterson refers to in the video, the way to combat this anxiety is to voluntarily put yourself in situations of risk. That’s right. Instead of doing everything you can to make your life easier or to numb the pain, go out there and CHOOSE to face the thing you are scared of. Clinical research shows that when you voluntarily (this is KEY) expose yourself to these anxiety-ridden situations your psychological response teaches you to become BRAVER. It’s not that the world becomes less scary, it’s that you see yourself as a person who is willing to do these things on a consistent basis and this is good for your self-esteem.</span></p>
                                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling everything I own, living a harder life that I wouldn’t know the outcome of, making things DIFFICULT and putting myself in the way uncertainty, IS the way to treat anxiety.&nbsp;</span></p>
